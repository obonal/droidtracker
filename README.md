Allow Android device users to share their exact location (using readable address and google map link) using SMS, Mail and Twitter.
Note that these app is very old (first publish early 2009) and has not been updated a lot since. I am still thinking of updating/rewriting it at some point though at least to use a more modern design (both UI and code wise) and make use of all the great changes to the Android SDK since.

Current version of the app can be found on the playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cauchy.android.tracker
